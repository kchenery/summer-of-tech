# Summer of Tech

This repository contains sample database for my SQL talk at Summer of Tech.

## Deploying the database

Either use SQL Server Data Tools (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ssdt/) to deploy the project or run the SummerOfTech_DB_Create.sql script to create the database and objects.
To populate the OrderHeader and OrderDetails data run the Orders.bat file from Data directory.

**Note:** I have removed my contact details, but I'm sure you can work them out!
